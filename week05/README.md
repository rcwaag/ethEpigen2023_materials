# Assignment

* Using the peaks you downloaded last week, identify bivalent domains (H3K27me3 + H3K4me3) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC)
  * Split those bivalent domains into those that overlap a TSS, and those that don’t.
* Question: what happens to those regions upon differentiation?
  * Choose a differentiated cell type (e.g. hepatocytes, neural progenitor, or smooth muscle cells)
  * Download the H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 peaks from this cell type
  * How many of the mESC bivalent domains are, in this differentiated cell type, overlapping either mark or their combination?
    * Provide a separate answer for domains that overlap a TSS and those that don’t.
